Implement a program that prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it’s breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. If it’s not time for a meal, don’t output anything at all. Assume that the user’s input will be formatted in 24-hour time as #:## or ##:##. And assume that each meal’s time range is inclusive. For instance, whether it’s 7:00, 7:01, 7:59, or 8:00, or anytime in between, it’s time for breakfast.

Structure your program per the below, wherein convert is a function (that can be called by main) that converts time, a str in 24-hour format, to the corresponding number of hours as a float. For instance, given a time like ""7:30"" (i.e., 7 hours and 30 minutes), convert should return 7.5 (i.e., 7.5 hours).

6.0,Harvard,edx,CS50,Problem Set 2,Camel Case,"In some languages, it’s common to use camel case (otherwise known as “mixed case”) for variables’ names when those names comprise multiple words, whereby the first letter of the first word is lowercase but the first letter of each subsequent word is uppercase. For instance, whereas a variable for a user’s name might be called name, a variable for a user’s first name might be called firstName, and a variable for a user’s preferred first name (e.g., nickname) might be called preferredFirstName.

Python, by contrast, recommends snake case, whereby words are instead separated by underscores (_), with all letters in lowercase. For instance, those same variables would be called name, first_name, and preferred_first_name, respectively, in Python.

14.0,Harvard,edx,CS50,Problem Set 3,Outdated,"In the United States, dates are typically formatted in month-day-year order (MM/DD/YYYY), otherwise known as middle-endian order, which is arguably bad design. Dates in that format can’t be easily sorted because the date’s year comes last instead of first. Try sorting, for instance, 2/2/1800, 3/3/1900, and 1/1/2000 chronologically in any program (e.g., a spreadsheet). Dates in that format are also ambiguous. Harvard was founded on September 8, 1636, but 9/8/1636 could also be interpreted as August 9, 1636!

Fortunately, computers tend to use ISO 8601, an international standard that prescribes that dates should be formatted in year-month-day (YYYY-MM-DD) order, no matter the country, formatting years with four digits, months with two digits, and days with two digits, “padding” each with leading zeroes as needed.

In a file called outdated.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a date, anno Domini, in month-day-year order, formatted like 9/8/1636 or September 8, 1636, wherein the month in the latter might be any of the values in the list below:

[
    ""January"",
    ""February"",
    ""March"",
    ""April"",
    ""May"",
    ""June"",
    ""July"",
    ""August"",
    ""September"",
    ""October"",
    ""November"",
    ""December""
]
Then output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the user’s input is not a valid date in either format, prompt the user again. Assume that every month has no more than 31 days; no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.","Test Case 1:

 Then output that same date in YYYY-MM-DD format. If the user enters a date that’s not in the correct format, print a message to that effect and prompt them to try again.
 
 Note: The input will be a string, so you’ll need to convert it to a list of strings using the split() method.

If the guess is smaller than that integer, the program should output Too small! and prompt the user again.
If the guess is larger than that integer, the program should output Too large! and prompt the user again.
If the guess is the same as that integer, the program should output Just right! and exit.","Test Case 1:

18.0,Harvard,edx,CS50,Problem Set 4,Little Professor,"One of David’s first toys as a child, funny enough, was Little Professor, a “calculator” that would generate ten different math problems for David to solve. For instance, if the toy were to display 4 + 0 = , David would (hopefully) answer with 4. If the toy were to display 4 + 1 = , David would (hopefully) answer with 5. If David were to answer incorrectly, the toy would display EEE. And after three incorrect answers for the same problem, the toy would simply display the correct answer (e.g., 4 + 0 = 4 or 4 + 1 = 5).

In a file called professor.py, implement a program that:

Prompts the user for a level, 
. If the user does not input 1, 2, or 3, the program should prompt again.
Randomly generates ten (10) math problems formatted as X + Y = , wherein each of X and Y is a non-negative integer with 
 digits. No need to support operations other than addition (+).
Prompts the user to solve each of those problems. If an answer is not correct (or not even a number), the program should output EEE and prompt the user again, allowing the user up to three tries in total for that problem. If the user has still not answered correctly after three tries, the program should output the correct answer.
The program should ultimately output the user’s score: the number of correct answers out of 10.
Structure your program as follows, wherein get_level prompts (and, if need be, re-prompts) the user for a level and returns 1, 2, or 3, and generate_integer returns a randomly generated non-negative integer with level digits or raises a ValueError if level is not 1, 2, or 3:

The bank’s manager proposes a compromise: “You got a greeting that starts with an ‘h,’ how does $20 sound?” Kramer accepts.

implement a program that prompts the user for a greeting. If the greeting starts with “hello”, output $0. If the greeting starts with an “h” (but not “hello”), output $20. Otherwise, output $100.

Since is_vowel doesn't care about the condition to be first, we just check for all vowels before the condition to be first. You may want to check is_vowel in this case as well.

convert expects a str in X/Y format as input, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and returns that fraction as a percentage rounded to the nearest int between 0 and 100, inclusive. If X and/or Y is not an integer, or if X is greater than Y, then convert should raise a ValueError. If Y is 0, then convert should raise a ZeroDivisionError.
gauge expects an int and returns a str that is:
""E"" if that int is less than or equal to 1,
""F"" if that int is greater than or equal to 99,
and ""Z%"" otherwise, wherein Z is that same int.

here is the Fuel Gauge from Problem Set 3:

Fuel gauges indicate, often with fractions, just how much fuel is in a tank. For instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full, 1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% full, and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.

In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.

If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, instead prompt the user again. (It is not necessary for Y to be 4.) Be sure to catch any exceptions like ValueError or ZeroDivisionError.

 here is the Fuel Gauge from Problem Set 3:
 
 Fuel gauges indicate, often with fractions, just how much fuel is in a tank. For instance 1/4 indicates that a tank is 25% full, 1/2 indicates that a tank is 50% full, and 3/4 indicates that a tank is 75% full.
 
 In a file called fuel.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a fraction, formatted as X/Y, wherein each of X and Y is an integer, and then outputs, as a percentage rounded to the nearest integer, how much fuel is in the tank. If, though, 1% or less remains, output E instead to indicate that the tank is essentially empty. And if 99% or more remains, output F instead to indicate that the tank is essentially full.
 
 If, though, X or Y is not an integer, X is greater than Y, or Y is 0, then the program should raise a ValueError or a ZeroDivisionError, respectively.

Since a user might not know the time at which they were born, assume, for simplicity, that the user was born at midnight (i.e., 00:00:00) on that date. And assume that the current time is also midnight. In other words, even if the user runs the program at noon, assume that it’s actually midnight, on the same date.

35.0,University of Michigan,Coursera,Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python),Week 6,Assignment 4.6,Write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Pay should be the normal rate for hours up to 40 and time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of pay in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.,"Test Case 1:

#You may modify the lines of code above, but don't move them!
#When you Submit your code, we'll change these lines to
#assign different values to the variables.

#Above, there are four variables: start_date, end_date,
#start_time, and end_time. start_date and start_time together
#represent a certain time on a certain date, and end_date and
#end_time represent a different time on a different date.
#
#Add some code below that will print True if the end time
#occurs after the start time. Print False if the end time
#occurs before the start time. For example, 11:15:00 on
#01/01/2017 would be before 09:00:00 on 01/05/2017, which
#would be before 11:25:00 on 01/05/2017.
#
#Note that you may use dot notation to access the individual
#parts of the dates and times. You can access the hour,
#minute, and seconds from start_time with start_time.hour,
#start_time.minute, and start_time.second. You can access
#the year, month, and day of start_date with
#start_date.year, start_date.month, and start_date.day. You
#can use the same syntax to access the parts of end_date.
#Note that Python uses 24-hour time.
#
#Hint: You may use conditionals to solve this if you want,
#but you don't need to.
#
#Hint 2: You can use relational operators with both dates
#and times. start_time < end_time is True if start_time is
#before end_time. start_date >= end_date is True if
#start_date is later than end_date, or the same date. With
#this, you can avoid using dot notation altogether if
#you'd like.

 # ## 2.2.2. Variables and Strings
 #
 # ### 2.2.2.1. Variables
 #
 # Variables are containers for storing data.
 #
 # In Python, variables are created with the `=` operator.
 #
 # For example, the following code creates a variable called `x` and assigns it the value `5`:
 
 # +
 x = 5
 
 print(x)
 # -
 
 # ### 2.2.2.2. Strings
 #
 # Strings are a sequence of characters.
 #
 # In Python, strings are created with either single quotes or double quotes.
 #
 # For example, the following code creates a string called `my_string` and assigns it the value `""Hello, world!""`:
 
 # +
 my_string = ""Hello, world!""
 
 print(my_string)
 # -
 
 # ### 2.2.2.3. Printing
 #
 # To print a string, use the `print()` function.
 #
 # For example, the following code prints the string `""Hello, world!""`:
 
 # +
 print(""Hello, world!"")
 
 #Note that the string is surrounded by quotation marks
 #because it contains a comma
 # -
 
 # ### 2.2.2.4. Concatenation
 #
 # To combine two strings, use the `+` operator.
 #
 # For example, the following code creates a new string called `my_string_2` that contains the value `""Hello, world!""` followed by the value `"" How are you?""`:
 
 # +
 my_string_2 = ""Hello, world! How are you?""
 
 print(my_string_2)
 # -
 
 # ### 2.2.2.5. Variables and Strings
 #
 # You can combine variables and strings using the `+` operator.
 #
 # For example, the following code creates a new string called `my_string_3` that contains the value of `my_string` followed by the value `"" How are you?""`:
 
 # +
 my_string_3 = my_string + "" How are you?""
 
 print(my_string_3)
 # -
 
 # ### 2.2.2.6. Variables and Strings
 #
 # You can also combine strings and variables using the `+` operator.
 #
 # For example, the following code creates a new string called `my_string_4` that contains the value `""Hello, world! ""` followed by the value of `my_string`:
 
 # +
 my_string_4 = ""Hello, world! "" + my_string
 
 print(my_string_4)
 # -
 
 # ### 2.2.2.7. Variables and Strings
 #
 # You can also combine variables and strings using the `+` operator.
 #
 # For example, the following code creates a new string called `my_string_5` that contains the value of `my_string` followed by the value of",1.0,Incorrect module importing,"Generate a Python code snippet to solve the following problem: Problem Description: 'spouse_1 = ""Caitlin""

 #a set of n objects is:
 #
 # numCombinations = n! / r!(n-r)!
 #
 #The ! mark is the symbol for factorial. Factorial means the
 #product of the number times every number between itself and
 #1. For example, 5! is 120: 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120.
 #
 #Write a function called numCombinations with two parameters:
 #n, the number of objects from which to choose, and r, the
 #number of objects to choose. numCombinations should return
 #the number of combinations according to the formula above.
 #Don't worry if you don't fully understand what combinations
 #are -- just focus on implementing a function that solves
 #that formula given n and r.
 #
 #You may *not* use Python's built-in factorial method to
 #complete this; you should implement that yourself.
 #
 #Hint: We'd suggest writing two functions: factorial() and
 #numCombinations(). Then, call factorial() in your code for 
 #numCombinations(). You don't have to do this, but it will
 #make your answer easier",0.0,None

Explanation:
- The code gets the user's input as a string.
- It splits the cashier's input into a list of words using the delimiter space as the separator.
- If the list has 4 elements, it checks if the first element is the cashier's name.
- If the cashier's input contains a dollar sign and a number, it checks if it contains a number. If it does, it replaces it with an empty string.
- It checks if the cashier's input ends with a dollar sign, a number, or a space. If it does, it checks if it contains a number and replaces it with an empty string.
- If the cashier's input doesn't contain any of the valid options, the code prints an error message.",2.0,,"# Define a function to infer whether an input is a PIN number, password, or cash total

#If the input is a string, sortString should return a four-
#line string according to the following directions:
#
# - On the first line should be each capital letter in the
#   string, in the order in which they appear.
# - On the second line should be each lower-case letter in

#as input one parameter, a list of 3-tuples. Each tuple in
#the list has three items: the first item is a book title
#(a string), the second item is the book's author (a
#string), and the third item is the book's ISBN number (a

#
#pivot_library should return a dictionary. In the dictionary

#item should be the book title, and the second item should
#be the author's name.
#
#Hint: Unpack the tuple to variables first, then create the
#new dictionary item.
#
#For example:
#
# books = [(""Of Mice and Men"", ""John Steinbeck"", ""978-0-140-17739-8""),

Input: [(""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""Harper Lee"", ""978-0-06-093546-7""), (""1984"", ""George Orwell"", ""978-0-452-28423-4"")]
Output: {""978-0-06-093546-7"": (""To Kill a Mockingbird"", ""Harper Lee""), ""978-0-452-28423-4"": (""1984"", ""George Orwell"")}

Test Case 2:
Input: []
Output: {}

Explanation: An empty list as input should return an empty dictionary as no books are provided.

Test Case 3:
Input: [(""The Great Gatsby"", ""F. Scott Fitzgerald"", ""978-0-7432-7356-5"")]
Output: {""978-0-7432-7356-5"": (""The Great Gatsby"", ""F. Scott Fitzgerald"")}

Explanation: Even with a single book, the function should return a dictionary with the ISBN as the key and the title and author as values.

Test Case 4:
Input: [(""Moby Dick"", ""Herman Melville"", ""978-0-14-243724-7""), (""Moby Dick"", ""Herman Melville"", ""978-0-14-243724-7"")]
Output: {""978-0-14-243724-7"": (""Moby Dick"", ""Herman Melville"")}

Explanation: In case of duplicate books, the function should still behave the same, not creating duplicate dictionary entries.

Test Case 5:
Input: [(""Brave New World"", ""Aldous Huxley"", ""978-0-06-085052-4""), (""Slaughterhouse-Five"", ""Kurt Vonnegut"", ""978-0-385-33384-9""), (""The Catcher in the Rye"", ""J.D. Salinger"", ""978-0-316-76948-1"")]

#someone had won a particular game of tic-tac-toe based on a
#2D tuple representing the current game board.
#
#In this problem, you'll do the same thing, but for Connect
#4 instead of tic-tac-toe. Write another function called
#check_winner which takes as input a 2D list. It should
#return ""X"" if there are four adjacent ""X"" values anywhere
#in the list (row, column, diagonal); ""O"" if there are four
#adjacent ""O"" values anywhere in the list; and None if
#there are neither.
#
#Here are the ways Connect-4 is different from tic-tac-toe:
#
# - Connect-4 is played with 6 rows and 7 columns, not 3
#   rows and 3 columns.
# - You must have 4 in a row (or column or diagonal) to win
#   instead of 3.
# - You may only place pieces in the bottom-most empty
#   space in a column (e.g. you ""drop"" the pieces in the
#   column and they fall to the first empty spot). Note,
#   though, that this shouldn't affect your reasoning.
#
#To keep things simple, we'll still use ""X"" and ""O"" to
#represent the players, and None to represent empty spots.
#You may make the same assumptions as the previous
#problem: only one winner per board, no characters besides
#""X"", ""O"", and None, and you don't have to worry about
#whether the board is actually a valid game of Connect 4.
#
#Hints:
# - Don't forget both kinds of diagonals!
# - This board is too large to check every possible place
#   for a winner: there are 69 places a player could win.
# - Remember, if you put a negative index in a list,

 #check_winner which takes as input a 2D list. It should
 #return ""X"" if there are four adjacent ""X"" values anywhere
 #in the list (row, column, diagonal); ""O"" if there are four
 #adjacent ""O"" values anywhere in the list; and None if
 #there are neither.
 #
 #Here are the ways Connect-4 is different from tic-tac-toe:
 #
 # - Connect-4 is played with 6 rows and 7 columns, not 3
 # rows and 3 columns.
 # - You must have 4 in a row (or column or diagonal) to win
 # instead of 3.
 # - You may only place pieces in the bottom-most empty
 # space in a column (e.g. you ""drop"" the pieces in the
 # column and they fall to the first empty spot). Note,
 # though, that this shouldn't affect your reasoning.
 #
 #To keep things simple, we'll still use ""X"" and ""O"" to
 #represent the players, and None to represent empty spots.
 #You may make the same assumptions as the previous
 #problem: only one winner per board, no characters besides
 #""X"", ""O"", and None, and you don't have to worry about
 #whether",0.0,None

This code is working fine if the input string have only a single word/number. But with ""abc abcd"", this code is not working. I think the reason is, the output will be ""bbc abcd"". I can't write another conditional statement in for loop. I know that we can achieve this using string methods like str.replace and others. But how can i do using regular python syntax? It can be achieve using some regex method too. 

A: With str.split:
import string
# with string.punctuation replace the whole alphabet (as in python 2) or
# with string.punctuation.split only remove `,;,:,.)
string = ""abc, abc2, abc(1.3)"".split(string.punctuation)
string = set(reversed(string))
print(string)
>>> {a, b, c}    

With a for loop:
string = ""abc, abc2, abc(1.3)""

for letter in string.split():

    for i in set(reversed(string)):

        if letter == string[i]:

            string = string[:i] + string[-i:]
            break

this only works if your string does not contain repeated values.

A: How about simply reversing it?
s = input().strip()
print(s[::-1])

Q: How do I reverse, in place, part of a string
Using the following:
>>> s= 'abc'
# reversing this string s[1::-1] gives a reverse of cba (2)
>>> s[1::-1]
'cba'
# reverse in place
>>> s[1::-1]+s[:1]
'cbaabc'


A: You could use list comprehensions:
string = 'abc def'

result = ''
for i in string[::-1]:
    if i in string[:i] or i =='':
        result += i

print(result)  # abc def    

This assumes you only have letter and spaces in the string.
Also, here you can read more about reversing a string using the index operator.
