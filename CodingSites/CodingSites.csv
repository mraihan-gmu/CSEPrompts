42,You are given a function f(X) = X^2. You are also given K lists. The ith list consists of Ni elements. You have to pick one element from each list so that the value from the equation below is maximized: S = (f(X1) + f(X2) + ... + f(Xk)) % M. Xi denotes the element picked from the ith list. Compute the maximum value of S % M.,"Test Case 1:
Input:
K = 2, M = 1000
Lists:
[2, 5, 4]
[8, 3]
Output:
897

Explanation:
The optimal solution is to pick 5 from the first list and 8 from the second list.
S = (5^2 + 8^2) % 1000 = (25 + 64) % 1000 = 89 % 1000 = 89.
However, we are looking for the maximum S % M which is 897 (since 1000 - 89 = 911).

Test Case 2:
Input:
K = 2, M = 100
Lists:
[1, 7]
[6, 9]
Output:
130

Explanation:
The optimal solution is 7 from the first list and 9 from the second list.
S = (7^2 + 9^2) % 100 = (49 + 81) % 100 = 130 % 100 = 30.
But, the maximum S % M is 130.

Test Case 3:
Input:
K = 3, M = 1000
Lists:
[1, 2]
[3, 4]
[5, 6]
Output:
161

Explanation:
The optimal solution is 2 from the first list, 4 from the second, and 5 from the third.
S = (2^2 + 4^2 + 5^2) % 1000 = (4 + 16 + 25) % 1000 = 45 % 1000 = 45.
The maximum S % M is 955.

Test Case 4:
Input:
K = 1, M = 10
Lists:
[3, 4, 5]
Output:
25

Explanation:
The optimal solution is 5 from the list.
S = 5^2 % 10 = 25 % 10 = 5.
The maximum S % M is 25.

Test Case 5:
Input:
K = 3, M = 100
Lists:
[10]
[10]
[10]
Output:
300

Explanation:
The optimal solution is to pick 10 from all three lists.
S = (10^2 + 10^2 + 10^2) % 100 = (100 + 100 + 100) % 100 = 300 % 100 = 0.
The maximum S % M is 300.

Test Case 2:
Input:
100 floors
Output:
14
